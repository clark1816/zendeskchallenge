# zendeskchallenge
coded zendesk challenge using python and the streamlit library to publish the webapp.

to run this program you must run 2 commands in your console or just click the link to take you to the web app.

//to run on local host//
1. type - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. type - streamlit run getdata.py

//to run on web browser//

what I learned from this challenge. I got a better understanding of making requests to an API in python and also learned how to use
the streamlit library better. 

Challenges I faced - At first I was having trouble getting connected to the zendesk api and getting my requests to come through. 
Once I figured it out it was smooth sailing. Till I got to the part when it came time to add the next and previous option. As you will see my program lacks those functions
this is because I was not able to figure out how to get it work with a json file. I got it to work with a large pandas data frame which was nicely organized in csv. I found online resources that showed different way but I would neeed help from someone to figure out how to add the next option in streamlit with a json file. I did attempt all the requirements and only fell short on one so I am very happy with my work on this challenge.I hope others are impressed as well. Other than that one thing that doesnt work all the other functions and features work great are organized well. 


Currently still working on getting the 25 day function to work will probaly be working by tonight 11.22.21 at around 9pm
