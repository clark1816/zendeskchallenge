//Challenges//
At first I was having trouble getting connected to the zendesk api and getting my requests to come through. 
Once I figured it out it was smooth sailing. Till I got to the part when it came time to add the next and previous option. I finally got them working but the small issue is you have to press them twice they are a bit unrepsonsive. 

//small issue
the next and previous buttons are a bit unresponsive so u have to click them twice to get them to work.
